# homebrew.c
Functions that calculate exp(), log(), and pow() from scratch

Homebrew functions for exp(), double mylog(),
math pow(), and a test main method for each function. It
then compares my "homebrewed" functions with the actual
functions within C library math.h which are not even
close to as accurate but was still fun to write!
